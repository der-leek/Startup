                Transcription is exhausting. Listening -- and re-listening -- to the same audio time after time to accurately 
                put speech to text is a waste of time and money. Simply put, it is a task humans should never need to perform. 
                Hence whisper.txt. Whisper.txt allows you to focus on what is most important by accurately and effortlessly 
                transcribing any audio file you throw at it. Simply log in, drop your audio, and let whisper.txt do the rest. 
                Stop transcribing. Start whispering.
