 - Hey, how are you doing today?
 - Good.
 - Good, are you parents home?
 - Hi.
 - Hey, how are you?
 - Good, you.
 - I'm doing great, thanks for asking.
 We're just going around to all the homes
 already have the solar panel set up.
 Just a few quick questions for you.
 How long have you had your system up?
 - I don't know, it's my parent's house.
 - Oh, it is?
 - I'm just here visiting.
 - Yeah, I know.
 - 10 years?
 - 10 years?
 - Yeah.
 - Do you remember what company they set it up?
 I know it's your parent's house.
 - Vivint.
 - Vivint?
 - Yeah.
 - Okay, that's awesome.
 Did you know that Vivint was purchased by Sunrun?
 - No.
 - Yeah, Sunrun's kind of the system that we work with.
 Have you guys had any issues with the system?
 - What did I know of?
 - Okay, yeah, a lot of your neighbors who have solar,
 they are actually using more energy
 than they're able to produce.
 So they're getting the big bills from medicine.
 You guys haven't been noticing any big bills from medicine.
 - No, I just know my mom's light bills, like five books.
 - That is awesome.
 - Yeah, yeah, that's how you wanted to be, right?
 - Yeah.
 - Yeah.
 - Well, that's perfect.
 Well, then it doesn't sound like I can help you up.
 Is there anything?
 - Okay.
 - You have a good one, all right?
 - Thank you, you too.
 Would you like some water or something?
 - You know, I'll take a water.
 Yeah, that's very generous.
 Thank you.
 (indistinct chatter)
 I'm gonna see if I would probably get it.
